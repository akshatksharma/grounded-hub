        transcript:"Since quarantine started, I started to spend a lot more time in my room and in like my personal spaces, and a lot of that  was creating a space. I was then encouraged to create a space that felt really personal to me and like welcoming and homey because if I was going to be spending that much time at like my desk for instance, I wanted to make sure that I was comfortable there. And, I've always really liked candles. I find them to be extremely calming, and I think that the light they emit is really beautiful. Very different than a lot of the harsh lights that I'm looking at on my computer all day and those sort of things. And the kind of warmth they give off also brings me a lot of joy and happiness. So, once I was getting settled in my St. Louis apartment, I spent a couple trips going to Target with my roommates to pick out various items, and I never went in with the intention of buying a candle but somehow always walked out with one and started building up a small collection in my apartment. I think in terms of the word 'Grounded' these things really do provide me with a sense of groundedness, and when I feel like when I light them, I have no choice but to be calm because the candle itself represents this calmness and especially with all these crazy things going on in the world - their nature of being illuminating and providing light in the darkness and calm in the eye of the storm and that sort of thing. I just started to build a deeper and deeper connection. And now every time I walk in my room, every time I sit down to do work, I reach for my lighter and I light a candle and leave it burning for probably a little too long. And it's brought me a lot of joy in these very confusing times and has allowed me to create spaces I feel comfortable in, especially because I spend so much time in them.",

        transcript:"While choosing Harry Potter 7 as my artifact is sort of a basic response to this prompt. Reading *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* was a really meaningful experience to me over quarantine and since the time the pandemic began. I actually didn't enter the Harry Potter game until a little bit later in my life. And by the time I entered high school, I was reading the fifth, and my mom just thought I was too old to be reading it, so I moved onto kind of more adult books at that time, and then came college, I still hadn't read the sixth or seventh book, which is crazy. And finally in quarantine, I really had a time to sit down and read. I didn't have anything else to do really, so it was my first time reading it. And although I wish I read *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* when I was younger, I absolutely loved reading it at age 21. And during such a stagnant time in the world, I felt like a kid again in my childhood house rather than this like 21 year old transplant at home. I was totally engrossed with the book. And just super absorbed. Staying up until 3am reading not knowing where the time went - what a wonderful experience that I haven't had in a really long time. It just like brought me a lot of happiness and most importantly, it was just like this amazing escape. You know reading that book and turning the pages, not knowing the time, not knowing where I was in the story - just fully living in this other world and universe and escaping the one we are currently in. So, it just - I hadn't felt like that in a while, and I think it meant more to me than ever because in a time where there's so much turmoil in the world, it felt really refreshing to sort of exit it for a moment. And just to have that outlet that was fun and creative and magical. I think in the end because it was so special and so fun, and I loved the book so much, that it allowed me to appreciate this downtime that we have. And I'm privileged in saying that because I know how difficult this has been for so many people on a way more intense scale than it has been for me. But I think in sitting and reflecting and relaxing and having a moment to breathe, and just pick up Harry Potter 7 and tear through it and have fun - I felt very appreciative of that bonus time.",

So yeah. It's weird taking in all that is going on but I've been trying to process it in different ways that help us focus on what's important.",

I bought this water bottle at the beginning of quarantine, and it represents the new mindset and  new goals that I had developed and have worked on since. First of all, it helped me improve my health— I decided to work out more often, drink more water, and eat healthier. I worked hard and my water bottle carried me through it, offering an ice cold reward whenever I succeeded. Second, I learned how to cook! Eating healthier meant learning what I should and shouldn’t put into my body, and how to find ways to control it. I still go for the occasional McDonalds or Taco Bell run, but also have created some of the most delicious meals I have ever had. Now, living apart from my parents,  I am so thankful that I took the time to learn. My water bottle has stayed with me throughout quarantine and will hopefully last me through the crazy, messed up year that is 2020 (it is also the longest I have had one without losing it, so that’s a good sign!). Here we go!"
